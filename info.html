Ronnie Dean Coleman (born May 13, 1964) is an American retired professional bodybuilder. The winner of the Mr. Olympia title for eight consecutive years, he is widely regarded as either 'the greatest' or one of the two greatest bodybuilders of all time along-with Arnold Schwarzenegger[4][5][6] and as the most dominant bodybuilding physique ever to grace the stage.[7] Winner of 26 IFBB professional titles, he is also renowned for his combination of size and conditioning,[8] dominant body-parts[9][10] and extremely heavy workouts,[11] making him the strongest bodybuilder and Mr. Olympia of all time.[12][13]

<br>Ronnie Dean Coleman was born in Monroe, Louisiana, on May 13, 1964.[2] He graduated cum laude from Grambling State University in 1984 with a BSc in accounting.[14] While there, he played football as a middle linebacker with the GSU Tigers under coach Eddie Robinson. After graduation, he failed to find work as an accountant and instead went to work at Domino's Pizza, where he would eat the complimentary pizza every day due to being so poor that he could barely afford to eat outside of work.[15] He then became a police officer in Arlington, Texas, serving as an officer from 1989 to 2000 and a reserve officer until 2003.[16]

<br>Coleman is a devout Christian.[33] He met French-Lebanese personal trainer Rouaida Christine Achkar at a sports exposition in Paris in March 1998,[34] and they were married in Beirut on December 28, 2007. They divorced soon after.[35] Coleman married American personal trainer Susan Williamson on April 11, 2016.[36] They reside in Arlington, Texas, and have four children together.[15]

<br>In June 2020, Coleman revealed that he can no longer walk unassisted due to botched surgical procedures.[37] Saying that he may never walk again, Coleman blamed his problems on questionable surgeries and noted that his last 3 surgeries cost a total of $2 million.

<br>With his trademark high-pitched voice, some of the vocal gimmicks Coleman popularized in his training videos have become commonplace in the global bodybuilding community, especially after the advent of viral videos.[31] The most popular of these, which he regularly shouted to himself as a form of self-encouragement, include "Yeah buddy!", "Light weight, baby!", and "Ain't nothin' but a peanut!"[32]
