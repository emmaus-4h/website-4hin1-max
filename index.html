        Bodybuilding is the use of progressive resistance exercise to control and develop one's muscles (muscle
        building) by muscle hypertrophy for aesthetic purposes.[1] It is distinct from similar activities such as
        powerlifting because it focuses on physical appearance instead of strength.[2] An individual who engages in this
        activity is referred to as a bodybuilder.

        <br>In professional bodybuilding, competitors appear in lineups and perform specified poses (and later
        individual posing routines) for a panel of judges who rank them based on symmetry, muscularity, size,
        conditioning, posing, and stage presentation. Bodybuilders prepare for competitions through the elimination of
        nonessential body fat, enhanced at the last stage by a combination of extracellular dehydration and
        carbo-loading, to achieve maximum muscular definition and vascularity; they also tan and shave to accentuate the
        contrast of their skin under the spotlights.[3]

        <br>A bodybuilder performs the incline dumbbell press.
        Bodybuilding takes a great amount of effort and time to reach the desired results. A bodybuilder might first be
        able to gain 8–20 pounds (4–9 kg) of muscle per year, if lifting for seven hours on a weekly basis. However,
        gains begin to slow down after the first two years to about 5–15 pounds (2–7 kg). After five years, gains can
        decrease to just 3–10 pounds (1–5 kg).[4]

        <br>Some bodybuilders use <strong id="Steroids"><a href="https://www.mega-gear.net/en/12-tren-enant-150.html">
          anabolic steroids</a></strong> and other performance-enhancing drugs to build muscles and recover
        from injuries more quickly, but competitions sometimes ban using them because of the health risks or
        considerations regarding fair competition. Despite some calls for testing for steroids, the leading bodybuilding
        federation (National Physique Committee) does not require testing.[5]

        <br>The winner of the annual IFBB Mr. Olympia contest is generally recognized as the world's top male
        professional bodybuilder. Since 1950, the NABBA Universe Championships have been considered the top amateur
        bodybuilding contests, with notable winners such as Reg Park, Lee Priest, Steve Reeves, Arnold Schwarzenegger.

        <br>n competitive bodybuilding, bodybuilders aspire to present an aesthetically pleasing body on stage.[37][38]
        In prejudging, competitors do a series of mandatory poses: the front lat spread, rear lat spread, front double
        biceps, back double biceps, side chest, side triceps, Most Muscular (men only), abdominals and thighs. Each
        competitor also performs a personal choreographed routine to display their physique. A posedown is usually held
        at the end of a posing round, while judges are finishing their scoring. Bodybuilders usually spend a lot of time
        practising their posing in front of mirrors or under the guidance of their coach.

        <br>In contrast to strongman or powerlifting competitions, where physical strength is paramount, or to Olympic
        weightlifting, where the main point is equally split between strength and technique, bodybuilding competitions
        typically emphasize condition, size, and symmetry. Different organizations emphasize particular aspects of
        competition, and sometimes have different categories in which to compete.[39]

        <br>Anabolic/androgenic steroid use
<br>This period also saw the rise of anabolic steroids in bodybuilding and many other sports. More significant use began with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sergio Oliva, and Lou Ferrigno in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and continuing through the 1980s with Lee Haney, the 1990s with Dorian Yates, Ronnie Coleman, and Markus Rühl, and up to the present day. Bodybuilders such as Greg Kovacs attained mass and size never seen previously but were not successful at the pro level. Others were renowned for their spectacular development of a particular body part, like Tom Platz or Paul Demayo for their leg muscles. At the time of shooting Pumping Iron, Schwarzenegger (while never admitting to steroid use until long after his retirement) said that "you have to do anything you can to get the advantage in competition".[citation needed] He would later say that he does not regret using anything.[18]

<br>To combat anabolic steroid use and in the hopes of becoming a member of the IOC, the IFBB introduced doping tests for both steroids and other banned substances. Although doping tests occurred, the majority of professional bodybuilders still used anabolic steroids for competition. During the 1970s, the use of anabolic steroids was openly discussed, partly due to the fact they were legal.[19] In the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990, U.S. Congress placed anabolic steroids into Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). In Canada, steroids are listed under Schedule IV of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, enacted by the federal Parliament in 1996.[20]

  <br>Men's physique
 <br>Due to those who found open-bodybuilding to be "too big" or "ugly" and unhealthy, a new category was started in 2013.[29] The first Men's Physique Olympia winner was Mark Wingson, who was followed by Jeremy Buendia for four consecutive years. Like open-bodybuilding, the federations in which bodybuilders can compete are natural divisions as well as normal ones. The main difference between the two is that men's physique competitors pose in board shorts rather than a traditional posing suit and open-bodybuilders are much larger and are more muscular than the men's physique competitors.[30] Open-bodybuilders have an extensive routine for posing while the Physique category is primarily judged by the front and back poses.[31] Many of the men's physique competitors are not above 200 lbs and have a bit of a more attainable and aesthetic physique in comparison to open-bodybuilders.[32] Although this category started off slowly, it has grown tremendously, and currently men's physique seems to be a more popular class than open-bodybuilding.[33]

 <div class="boxH2"></br>Natural bodybuilding 
 <br>Main article: Natural bodybuilding
Due to the growing concerns of the high cost, health consequences, and illegal nature of some steroids, many organizations have formed in response and have deemed themselves "natural" bodybuilding competitions. In addition to the concerns noted, many promoters of bodybuilding have sought to shed the "freakish" perception that the general public has of bodybuilding and have successfully introduced a more mainstream audience to the sport of bodybuilding by including competitors whose physiques appear much more attainable and realistic.[28]

 <br>In natural contests, the testing protocol ranges among organizations from lie detectors to urinalysis. Penalties also range from organization to organization from suspensions to strict bans from competition. It is also important to note that natural organizations also have their own list of banned substances and it is important to refer to each organization's website for more information about which substances are banned from competition. There are many natural bodybuilding organizations; some of the larger ones include: MuscleMania, Ultimate Fitness Events (UFE), INBF/WNBF, and INBA/PNBA. These organizations either have an American or worldwide presence and are not limited to the country in which they are headquartered.[28</div>
